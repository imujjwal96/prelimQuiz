prelimQuiz is an open source, simple and powerful self-hosted quiz platform with the backend of Object Oriented PHP that lets an organiser host a quiz either on a local server or in the cloud. It has a beautifully designed interface and it is customizable in a way that it offers you to choose your own type of quiz, be it a Multiple Choice Questions quiz, a general one word or sentence quiz or a mix of both. The front end of the website can be easily manipulated allowing you to give a personal touch to the website.
